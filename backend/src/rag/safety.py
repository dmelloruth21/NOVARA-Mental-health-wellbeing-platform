Two functions:
  check_pre_generation(message)  → (is_safe, reason)
  check_post_generation(reply)   → (is_safe, list_of_issues)

Pre-check: Before the AI even sees your message, the function 
  check_pre_generation scans it for "crisis" words.
Post-check: After the AI writes a reply, the function check_post_generation scans the 
   bot's own words to make sure it didn't give unsafe medical advice.
